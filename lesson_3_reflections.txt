When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others or when you want to create a public repository for everyone to see 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    so that only the necessary changes are pulled

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clone of a different repository made on github itself, clone is making a copy of a repository locally or on github and branches are separting code from the master. Forks would be used when someone else's repository on github has to be edited

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

In case you are offline, updates can still be made and the last known state can be checked to see whether you are connected to the github repo or not

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Collaborating with github will be easier as the code can be pushed and pulled from the same public repo. In case of merging different branches, pull requests make checking and updating the merge easier for the collaborators

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When experimental changes are made or when there are changes that need to be approved or need feedback from other other collaborators before merging with the master to prevent breaking the code in master branch
